The goal of qbgbaReader is to read XML files containing the German "Qualitaetsberichte der Krankenhaeuser" obtained from the "Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss" (GBA) and insert them into a SQL-database.


## Installation

You can install the released version of qbgbaReader from [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/klinik-db/qbgbaReader) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_gitlab("klinik-db/qbgbaReader")
```


## Usage

This package gives you the means to read in the raw data, i.e., the XML-files obtained from the GBA. These are not included in the package, but must be requested from the GBA. One year of data takes about 2.3GB of disk space and contains nearly 8,000 files. The following code assumes that you have these XML-files available.

### Loading packages

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)
library(readxl)
library(qbgbaReader)
library(DBI)
library(RMariaDB)
library(progressr)

```

### Open a connection to the database

This assumes, that you have either a MySQL or a MariaDB server setup with an administrative user account (that has permission to create, drop and alter a schema). Using the odbc-package with the following syntax gave weird problems regarding the encoding of special characters, at least for us. With the odbc package, you can choose either the [MySQL-Driver](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/) or the [MariaDB connector](https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors) as the driver. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Setting up the credentials using the keyring-package:

keyring::key_set(service = "mysql-localhost",
                 username = "dataadmin")


# NOT working because of encoding errors with the German special characters:
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                 Driver   = "MariaDB ODBC 3.1 Driver",
                 Server   = "localhost",
                 Port     = 3306,
                 UID      = keyring::key_list("mysql-localhost")[1,2],
                 PWD      = keyring::key_get("mysql-localhost", "dataadmin"))
```

Because of the encoding difficulties, the RMariaDB-package is used for the connection instead. This again bears the little inconvenience, that the user credentials must be set up using the standard authentification hashing algorithm (`mysql_native_password`) and **not** use the newer `caching_sha2_password` algorithm, which is the default for MySQL Server version 8 and later. For a discussion of this matter, see this [Github issue](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB/issues/134).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# This works:
con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(),
                 host     = "localhost",
                 port     = 3306,
                 username = keyring::key_list("mysql-localhost")[1,2],
                 password = keyring::key_get("mysql-localhost", "dataadmin"),
                 dbname   = "gbadata"
)
```

Then, we further need the list of XML-files with the full path names, the XML schema file for the corresponding year (these can be obtained from the [GBA website](https://www.g-ba.de/themen/qualitaetssicherung/datenerhebung-zur-qualitaetssicherung/datenerhebung-qualitaetsbericht/servicedateien/) together with the Excel files comprising the selective lists for the respective years. For your convenience, schema and selective list files are included in the source of this package (not in the already built and installed package!!), look into directory `./data-raw`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
lists_2019 <-
  qb_extract_selective_lists(
    "./data-raw/SelectiveLists/2020-04-01_Anlage-4_Qb-R_Auswahllisten_BJ-2019.xlsx"
  )
XML_Schema_path_2019 <- "./data-raw/XML-SchemaFiles/2020-10-07_Anlage-5_XML_Schema-BJ-2019.xsd"

reports_detailed <- list.files("../2019_v2/Berichte-Teile-A-B-C/", 
                               pattern = "-xml\\.xml$", 
                               full.names = TRUE)

```

Next, we need the data set with the global identifier for each of the hospitals. In this file, every hospital is assigned to one ID number that is the same over several years, so that you can track the data for one hospital over the years. The problem is acutally, that the ID listed in the XML files (i.e., the "IK-number") is not correct sometimes and also might change over time. Therefore, the raw data cannot identify each hospital correctly through time. Again, this file is included in the directory `./data-raw` (i.e., in the source files), not in the built and installed one!

```{r eval = FALSE}
GlobalHospitalID <- readxl::read_excel("./data-raw/GlobalHospitalID.xlsx",
                                       col_types = c(rep("text", times = 9),
                                                     "numeric",
                                                     "numeric"))

GlobalHospitalID <- GlobalHospitalID %>%
    mutate(idHospitalDataYear = case_when(
        year == "2015" ~ 1L,
        year == "2016" ~ 2L,
        year == "2017" ~ 3L,
        year == "2018" ~ 4L,
        year == "2019" ~ 5L
    ))

```


Now you can read in the complete year of data in one go, with activated file logging, error catching and a nice progressbar:

```{r eval = FALSE}
results_2019_all <- with_progress(
    qb_extract_many_clinics(
        conn = con,
        xml_file_names = reports_detailed,
        xml_schema_path = XML_Schema_path_2019,
        global_hospital_id = GlobalHospitalID,
        years_lookuptable = c(
            "1" = 2015,
            "2" = 2016,
            "3" = 2017,
            "4" = 2018,
            "5" = 2019
        ),
        db_name = "gbadata",
        logging = TRUE
    )
)

# Get possible errors:
results_2019_all_df <- map_dfr(results_2019_all, `[`, .id = "number")
results_2019_all_df[results_2019_all_df$Type == "error", ]
save(results_2019_all_df, file = "results_2019_all_df.RData")

table(results_2019_all_df$Type)

```

Good Luck!
